        NOUN had everything they wanted, but they also had a NOUN, and their greatest fear was that somebody would VERB it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone VERBs about NOUN. NOUN was NOUN’s sister, but they hadn’t VERBed for several years; in fact, NOUN pretended she didn’t have a NOUN, because her NOUN and her good-for-nothing NOUN were as ADJECTIVE as it was possible to be. NOUN shuddered to VERB what the NOUNs would say if the NOUN VERBed in the street. The NOUN knew that the NOUNs had a small NOUN, too, but they had never even seen NOUN. This NOUN was another good reason for keeping NOUN away; they didn’t want NOUN VERBing with NOUN like that.
